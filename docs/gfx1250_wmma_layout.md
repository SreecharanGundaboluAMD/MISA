# gfx1250 WMMA register layout (empirically verified)

Verified on real gfx1250 hardware (this machine) via `/tmp/wmma_probe/{probe.s,host.cpp}`:
an end-to-end round-trip test that loads random 16x32 (A) and 32x16 (B) fp16 matrices into
VGPRs per the formulas below, executes `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16`, reads back the D operand
per the formula below, and compares against a CPU-computed reference. Matched exactly across
5 random-seed trials.

## `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16 D, A, B, C` (M=16, N=16, K=32, fp16 in / fp32 accum)

Wave32. For lane `l` (0..31):

- **A operand** (8 VGPRs/lane, packed 2 fp16/dword): for vgpr index `a` (0..7), half `s` (0/1):
  `row = l % 16`, `k = (l / 16) * 16 + a*2 + s`
- **B operand** (8 VGPRs/lane, same packing): for vgpr index `a` (0..7), half `s` (0/1):
  `col = l % 16`, `k = (l / 16) * 16 + a*2 + s`
- **C/D operand** (8 VGPRs/lane, fp32): for vgpr index `j` (0..7):
  `row = (l / 16) * 8 + j`, `col = l % 16`

In words: the 32-lane wave splits into two 16-lane halves along `l/16`. Each half independently
covers all 16 rows (`l%16`) of A and all 16 columns (`l%16`) of B, but only half the K range
(k=0..15 for the lower half, k=16..31 for the upper half) — the two halves' partial products are
summed by the instruction itself. For the output, the two halves instead split the **M** range
(rows 0..7 vs 8..15), each producing the full 16 columns.

C and D may be distinct register ranges (no aliasing requirement) — confirmed via `llvm-mc`
accepting `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16 v[40:47], v[8:15], v[16:23], v[0:7]`.

## Not yet re-verified for other instructions

This was only verified for `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_f16`. The same formula is assumed (not yet
re-verified) to generalize to `v_wmma_f32_16x16x32_bf16` (identical operand footprint) and,
with `k` ranging over the appropriate wider set, to the K=64/K=128 int8/fp8 variants and the
K=4 fp32 variant. Re-run the round-trip probe before relying on this for a new instruction/dtype.

## GCN12.5 ISA quirks found along the way (relevant to any gfx1250 codegen, not just WMMA)

- `.amdhsa_ieee_mode`, `.amdhsa_dx10_clamp`, `.amdhsa_workgroup_processor_mode` kernel-descriptor
  directives are all rejected by the assembler on gfx1250 (fixed in `python/codegen/amdgpu.py`).
- Carry-out arithmetic uses `vcc_lo` (not bare `vcc`) and `v_add_co_ci_u32` (not `v_addc_co_u32`).
- Waitcnt is split into separate `s_wait_loadcnt` / `s_wait_storecnt` / `s_wait_dscnt` /
  `s_wait_kmcnt` instructions instead of a single `s_waitcnt vmcnt()/lgkmcnt()`.
- The asm→hsaco recipe must use `-target amdgcn-amd-amdhsa` (full triple with "amd" vendor);
  the vendor-less `amdgcn--amdhsa` triple used in some older MISA test scripts
  (`test/persistent_workgroup/build.sh`) produces a target-id mismatch against the
  `.amdgcn_target` directive and fails to assemble.
